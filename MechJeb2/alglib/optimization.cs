            NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

    DESCRIPTION:
    The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
    nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

    These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
    long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
    L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


    REQUIREMENTS:
    Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
    * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
       other functions
    3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
    4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
       with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
    finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

    Description below contains information which is specific to this function
    only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
    information about creation of CG optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
       Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
       nonlinear problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

    There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
    same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related

    This function allows to suggest initial step length to the CG algorithm.

    Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
    can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
    (which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
    magnitude different from the desired step.

    Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
    step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
    step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
    then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get
    10^44, which is still too large.

    This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from
    some moderate step length, like 1.0, so algorithm will be able  to  detect
    desired step length in a several searches.

    Default behavior (when no step is suggested) is to use preconditioner,  if
    it is available, to generate initial estimate of step length.

    This function influences only first iteration of algorithm. It  should  be
    called between MinCGCreate/MinCGRestartFrom() call and MinCGOptimize call.

       Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
       (either MinCGCreate()  for analytical gradient  or  MinCGCreateF()  for
       numerical differentiation) you should  choose  appropriate  variant  of
       MinCGOptimize() - one which accepts function AND gradient or one  which
       accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize()  which  corresponds  to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed  to  MinCGOptimize()  and  specific
       function used to create optimizer.

       function and MinCGOptimize() version. Attemps to use  such  combination
       (for  example,  to create optimizer with  MinCGCreateF()  and  to  pass

                         BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
           WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

    DESCRIPTION:
    The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
    combination of:
    * bound constraints
    * linear inequality constraints
    * linear equality constraints

    REQUIREMENTS:
    * user must provide function value and gradient
    * starting point X0 must be feasible or
      not too far away from the feasible set
    * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
      L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
    * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

    USAGE:

    Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
    Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
    you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
    on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

    2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
       MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

    3. User sets stopping conditions for underlying unconstrained solver
       with MinBLEICSetInnerCond() call.
       This function controls accuracy of underlying optimization algorithm.

    4. User sets stopping conditions for outer iteration by calling
       MinBLEICSetOuterCond() function.
       This function controls handling of boundary and inequality constraints.

    5. Additionally, user may set limit on number of internal iterations
       by MinBLEICSetMaxIts() call.
       This function allows to prevent algorithm from looping forever.

    6. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

    7. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

    8. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
       with same N but another starting point.
       MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
        X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                    * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                    * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                      to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                      approximation.

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure stores algorithm state

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
    finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

    Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
    only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
    more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
       gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
       problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
        EpsX    -   >0, stopping condition on outer iteration step length
        EpsI    -   >0, stopping condition on infeasibility

    Both EpsX and EpsI must be non-zero.

    MEANING OF EpsX

    EpsX  is  a  stopping  condition for outer iterations. Algorithm will stop
    when  solution  of  the  current  modified  subproblem will be within EpsX
    (using 2-norm) of the previous solution.

    MEANING OF EpsI

    EpsI controls feasibility properties -  algorithm  won't  stop  until  all
    inequality constraints will be satisfied with error (distance from current
    point to the feasible area) at most EpsI.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
    functions.

    There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
    same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
    forms of tuning solver.

    NOTES:

    1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
       (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
       only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain

       Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object

       for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
       MinBLEICOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
       which accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinBLEICOptimize() which corresponds to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBLEICOptimize()  and specific
       function used to create optimizer.

       Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
       function  and  MinBLEICOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
       combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBLEICCreateF()
       and  to  pass  gradient  information  to  MinCGOptimize()) will lead to
       exception being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS
       needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

            LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

    DESCRIPTION:
    The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
    Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
    of memory.
    The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
    using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
    It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
    value of order 2*N*M.


    REQUIREMENTS:
    Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
    * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
       and other functions
    3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
    4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
       with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension. N>0
        M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                    approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                    value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                    considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                    performance. M<=N.
        X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state


    NOTES:
    1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
    2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
       optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
       use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
       L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
       Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
       nonlinear problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
    functions.

    There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
    same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
    forms of tuning solver.

        grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)

    NOTES:

    1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
       (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
       only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
       gradient.

       Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
       (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
       for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
       MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
       which accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific
       function used to create optimizer.


                         |         USER PASSED TO MinLBFGSOptimize()
       CREATED WITH      |  function only   |  function and gradient

       MinLBFGSCreate()  |     FAIL                work

       Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
       function  and  MinLBFGSOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
       combination (for example, to create optimizer with MinLBFGSCreateF() and
       to pass gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to exception
       being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS needed or
       you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

    DESCRIPTION:
    This function is used to find minimum of function which is represented  as
    sum of squares:
        F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])
    using value of function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[].


    REQUIREMENTS:
    This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

    * function vector f[] at given point X
    * function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at given point

    There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
    correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
    unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
    First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates
    f[] and Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].

    You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
    use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
    works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
    will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
    Jacobian.


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
       other functions
    3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
       callback functions.
    4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
       with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   dimension, N>1
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used

        M       -   number of functions f[i]
        X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:

    NOTES:
    1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
    2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
       optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,

    second  one  calculates  F(x)  and  grad F(x),  third one calculates F(x),
    grad F(x), hess F(x).

    You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with FGH-function and  then
    use incorrect version of MinLMOptimize() (for example, version which  does
    not provide Hessian matrix), but it will lead to  exception  being  thrown
    after first attempt to calculate Hessian.


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateFGH() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
       other functions
    3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
       pointers (delegates, etc.) to callback functions.
    4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
       with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   dimension, N>1
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
    2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
       optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
       use MinLMSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for LM optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
    optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
    condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

    Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
    important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
    easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
    stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
    relaxed stopping conditions).

    You can choose between three acceleration strategies:

      iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
      we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
      differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
      settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
      iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

    AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost  is  prohibitive
    high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
    Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).

    NOTES:

    1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
       may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
       said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
       different sets of callbacks.

       This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
       MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
       does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
       will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

       Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
       compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

        /*************************************************************************
                NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

        DESCRIPTION:
        The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
        nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

        These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
        long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
        L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


        REQUIREMENTS:
        Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
        * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
           other functions
        3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
        4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
           with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X

        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
        information about creation of CG optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
           Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
           nonlinear problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

        There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        This function allows to suggest initial step length to the CG algorithm.

        Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
        can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
        (which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
        magnitude different from the desired step.

        Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
        step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
        step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
        then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get
        10^44, which is still too large.

        This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from
        some moderate step length, like 1.0, so algorithm will be able  to  detect
        desired step length in a several searches.

        Default behavior (when no step is suggested) is to use preconditioner,  if
        it is available, to generate initial estimate of step length.

           function and MinCGOptimize() version. Attemps to use  such  combination
           (for  example,  to create optimizer with  MinCGCreateF()  and  to  pass
           gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to  exception  being
           thrown. Either  you  did  not  pass  gradient when it WAS needed or you
           passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

        This function sets low-rank preconditioner for Hessian matrix  H=D+V'*C*V,
        where:
        * H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/V/C
        * D=D1+D2 is a diagonal matrix, which includes two positive definite terms:
          * constant term D1 (is not updated or infrequently updated)
          * variable term D2 (can be cheaply updated from iteration to iteration)
        * V is a low-rank correction
        * C is a diagonal factor of low-rank correction

        Preconditioner P is calculated using approximate Woodburry formula:
            P  = D^(-1) - D^(-1)*V'*(C^(-1)+V*D1^(-1)*V')^(-1)*V*D^(-1)
               = D^(-1) - D^(-1)*VC'*VC*D^(-1),
        where
            VC = sqrt(B)*V
            B  = (C^(-1)+V*D1^(-1)*V')^(-1)
            
        Note that B is calculated using constant term (D1) only,  which  allows us
        to update D2 without recalculation of B or   VC.  Such  preconditioner  is
        exact when D2 is zero. When D2 is non-zero, it is only approximation,  but
        very good and cheap one.

        This function accepts D1, V, C.
        D2 is set to zero by default.

        Cost of this update is O(N*VCnt*VCnt), but D2 can be updated in just O(N)
        by MinCGSetPrecVarPart.

                             BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
               WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

        DESCRIPTION:
        The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
        combination of:
        * bound constraints
        * linear inequality constraints
        * linear equality constraints

        REQUIREMENTS:
        * user must provide function value and gradient
        * starting point X0 must be feasible or
          not too far away from the feasible set
        * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
          L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
        * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

        USAGE:

        Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
        Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
        you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
        on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

        2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
           MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

        3. User sets stopping conditions for underlying unconstrained solver
           with MinBLEICSetInnerCond() call.
           This function controls accuracy of underlying optimization algorithm.

        4. User sets stopping conditions for outer iteration by calling
           MinBLEICSetOuterCond() function.
           This function controls handling of boundary and inequality constraints.

        5. Additionally, user may set limit on number of internal iterations
           by MinBLEICSetMaxIts() call.
           This function allows to prevent algorithm from looping forever.

        6. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

        7. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

        8. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
           with same N but another starting point.
           MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
            X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                        * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                        * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                          to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                          approximation.

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state

        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
        more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used

            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
           gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
           problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        This function sets linear constraints for BLEIC optimizer.

                        All elements of C (including right part) must be finite.

                        * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

        NOTE 1: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:
        * there always exists some minor violation (about Epsilon in magnitude)
          due to rounding errors
        * numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
          outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
          numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.
        If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
        problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
        (this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
        solution and in all intermediate points).

        Both EpsX and EpsI must be non-zero.

        MEANING OF EpsX

        EpsX  is  a  stopping  condition for outer iterations. Algorithm will stop
        when  solution  of  the  current  modified  subproblem will be within EpsX
        (using 2-norm) of the previous solution.

        MEANING OF EpsI

        EpsI controls feasibility properties -  algorithm  won't  stop  until  all
        inequality constraints will be satisfied with error (distance from current
        point to the feasible area) at most EpsI.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
        functions.

        There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        /*************************************************************************
                LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

        DESCRIPTION:
        The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
        Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
        of memory.
        The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
        using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
        It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
        value of order 2*N*M.


        REQUIREMENTS:
        Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
        * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
           and other functions
        3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
        4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
           with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension. N>0
            M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                        approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                        value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                        considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                        performance. M<=N.
            X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
            

        NOTES:
        1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
        2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
           optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
           use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
           L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinLBFGSCreate() in  order  to  get
        more information about creation of LBFGS optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used

            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
           Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
           nonlinear problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        or  other  fast  growing  functions,  and optimization algorithm makes too
        large  steps  which  leads  to overflow. This function allows us to reject
        steps  that  are  too  large  (and  therefore  expose  us  to the possible
        overflow) without actually calculating function value at the x+stp*d.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
        functions.

        There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

           gradient.

           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
           (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
           for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
           MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one

           Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
           callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific

                         NON-LINEAR LEAST SQUARES OPTIMIZATION

        DESCRIPTION:
        This function is used to find minimum of function which is represented  as
        sum of squares:
            F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])
        using value of function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[].


        REQUIREMENTS:
        This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

        * function vector f[] at given point X
        * function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at given point

        There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
        correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
        unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
        First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates
        f[] and Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].

        You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
        use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
        works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
        will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
        Jacobian.


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
           other functions
        3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
           callback functions.
        4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
           with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   dimension, N>1
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            M       -   number of functions f[i]
            X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
        2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
           optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
           use MinLMSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.

        DESCRIPTION:
        This  function  is  used  to  find  minimum  of general form (not "sum-of-

            F = F(x[0], ..., x[n-1])
        using  its  gradient  and  Hessian.  Levenberg-Marquardt modification with

        not provide Hessian matrix), but it will lead to  exception  being  thrown
        after first attempt to calculate Hessian.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for LM optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
        optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
        condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

        Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
        important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
        easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
        stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
        relaxed stopping conditions).

        This function is used to change acceleration settings

        You can choose between three acceleration strategies:
        * AccType=0, no acceleration.
        * AccType=1, secant updates are used to update quadratic model after  each
          iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
          we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
          differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
          settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
          iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

        AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost  is  prohibitive
        high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
        Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).
        It should also be used when we have no Jacobian, because finite difference
        approximation takes too much time to compute.

        Table below list  optimization  protocols  (XYZ  protocol  corresponds  to
        MinLMCreateXYZ) and acceleration types they support (and use by  default).

        ACCELERATION TYPES SUPPORTED BY OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOLS:

        protocol    0   1   comment
        V           +   +
        VJ          +   +
        FGH         +

        DAFAULT VALUES:

        protocol    0   1   comment
        V               x   without acceleration it is so slooooooooow
        VJ          x
        FGH         x

        NOTE: this  function should be called before optimization. Attempt to call
        it during algorithm iterations may result in unexpected behavior.

        NOTE: attempt to call this function with unsupported protocol/acceleration
        combination will result in exception being thrown.

        NOTES:

        1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
           may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
           said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
           different sets of callbacks.

           This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
           MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
           does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
           will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

           Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
           compile time - you can see them at runtime only.
